  # This section configures the available performance states (Operating Performance Points).
  # The governor will scale the GPU frequency and voltage between these min and max values.
  frequency:
    min: 350   # Minimum GPU core frequency in MHz
    max: 2000   # Maximum GPU core frequency in MHz
  voltage:
    min: 700    # Minimum GPU voltage in mV
    max: 1000   # Maximum GPU voltage in mV
  steps: 24     # Number of steps between min and max, creating 25 OPPs (0 to 24)
